# Public Duelist Project
A public non-updatable version of a private project.

Public version of a closed project I'm currently working on (as of July 2022).

<b>What is a project?</b><br>
This is a single-player turn-based RogueLike PC game (only the combat system has been developed so far).

<b>How to play?</b><br>
You control a squad of up to 6 characters and must defeat a similar squad. Each character has 6 clickable abilities (3 active and 3 skills (skills are the same for all characters)) and 3 passive ones. During the round, each unit can perform a certain number of actions using a clickable ability. The team that has no characters left in the squad loses.

<b>Where is the project being developed and how to launch it?</b><br>
The project is being developed on Unity 2021.3.4f1. To work, you need to install 3 packages: Text Mesh Pro, Input System and Universal Render Pipeline (the latter is needed for particles to work correctly, but is not required for the project).
